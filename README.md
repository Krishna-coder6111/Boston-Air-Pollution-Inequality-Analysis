# Boston Air Pollution Inequality Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of air pollution inequality in Boston, focusing on the impact of deforestation and the creation of heat islands in various neighborhoods.

## Introduction

Air pollution inequality has become a significant concern in urban areas such as Boston. 
<\br >This project aims to analyze the differences in air pollution levels and their impact on various demographic groups. The analysis is based on data from the 2000 and 2010 Census, which includes information on race, income, educational attainment, and rural/urban land classification. The study also utilizes modeled PM2.5 concentrations from 2003 to 2010 and NO2 concentrations from 2005 to 2010.

## Key Findings

- The gap between exposure to PM2.5 for non-Hispanic black populations and non-Hispanic white populations decreased by 35% between 2005 and 2010.
- The gap between exposure to annual NO2 for non-Hispanic black populations and non-Hispanic white populations decreased by 24% between 2005 and 2010.
- Lower-income neighborhoods in Boston experience "heat islands" with temperatures up to 7 degrees higher than the city's average due to a lack of green space and an abundance of concrete, steel, and buildings.
